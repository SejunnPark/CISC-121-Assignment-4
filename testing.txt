Test 1.
INPUT: ADD, DAD
REASON: Testing if Anagram feature works

This program will determine if the strings you have entered are Anagrams
Enter two strings below that contain ONLY upper-case letters and no spaces:
Enter String 1: ADD
Enter String 2: DAD
The two strings you have entered are Anagrams!


Test 2.
INPUT: HELLO, WORLD
REASON: If the strings are not anagrams

This program will determine if the strings you have entered are Anagrams
Enter two strings below that contain ONLY upper-case letters and no spaces:
Enter String 1: HELLO
Enter String 2: WORLD
The two strings you have entered are not Anagrams...


Test 3.
INPUT: Lower, Case
REASON: if the strings were lower case

This program will determine if the strings you have entered are Anagrams
Enter two strings below that contain ONLY upper-case letters and no spaces:
Enter String 1: Lower
Enter String 2: Case
Error. Did not input a string or string was not all upper-case or the string contained spaces...


Test 4.
INPUT: 1234, 4321
REASON: not inputting a string

MAIN OUTPUTS FOR CODE 2

Test 1.
INPUT: ABC, CBA
REASON: Testing if sort works

This program will first convert the string the user enters into a matching prime number
Then sort it in increasing order using radix sort
Enter two strings below that contain ONLY upper-case letters and no spaces:
Enter String 1: ABC
Enter String 2: CBA
Here is the new sorted prime number list: [2, 2, 3, 3, 5, 5]


Test 2.
INPUT: FED , BAG
REASON: Testing if sort works for two-digit numbers

This program will first convert the string the user enters into a matching prime number
Then sort it in increasing order using radix sort
Enter two strings below that contain ONLY upper-case letters and no spaces:
Enter String 1: FED
Enter String 2: BAG
Here is the new sorted prime number list: [2, 3, 7, 11, 13, 17]

* Theoretically the code should produce the list above however, for some reason the code kept running
    delaying the output and was having trouble finishing the code *

Test 3.
INPUT: lower, case
REASON: Testing if lower case letter works

This program will first convert the string the user enters into a matching prime number
Then sort it in increasing order using radix sort
Enter two strings below that contain ONLY upper-case letters and no spaces:
Enter String 1: lower
Enter String 2: case
